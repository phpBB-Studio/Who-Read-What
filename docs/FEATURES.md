# Who Read What

This extension marks posts as "read" automatically, just by a user scrolling through the viewtopic page. 

It will take all the posts of the entire page and look to see what posts are actually in the "viewport". 

Provides a detailed set of statistics and lists based on various criteria such as User/Group/Automatic reading time/Manual Reading time when used in conjunction with our extension "HLPOSTS". 

The settings are rather finely tuned.
